<!-- Thank you for submitting a bug report! Please use the below template to help structure your report. Try to fill out as many details as you can, as Next.js configuration can differ a lot. -->

### Issue Summary
<!-- A short summary of what the bug or issue is. -->

### Actual behavior
<!-- A clear and concise description of what actually happened. -->

### Expected behavior
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. Please compare against the Next.js local server even if it's behavior may not be the most robust or handle the most edge cases, as we would like to keep in parity with it. -->

### Steps to reproduce
<!-- Add steps to reproduce the actual behavior. Please try to fill this as specific as possible, it will help us diagnose the issue faster. If you have a GH repo to share a minimal reproduction, that's even better :) -->

### Screenshots/Code/Configuration/Logs
<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or a minimal repro (e.g code or configuration snippet or repository) to help explain your problem. If you have a runtime issue from Lambda/CloudFront, please check CloudWatch logs (note that Lambda@Edge logs are in a region closest to where you access CloudFront - NOT necessarily in `us-east-1` where the original Lambda is created) and post any logs or stacktraces if possible. See here for how to check logs: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/lambda-edge-testing-debugging.html#lambda-edge-identifying-function-errors. If you have a build or deploy issue, please run with serverless --debug and post the logs. Please also post your serverless.yml. -->

### Versions
<!-- Please add your OS from where you are deploying (e.g Mac, Windows, Ubuntu via GitHub CI) and @savaleukhin/serverless-component and Next.js versions below. Note that only the last sub-versions within the last two major version of Next.js are officially tested and supported. -->

- OS/Environment:
- @savaleukhin/serverless-component version:
- Next.js version:

### Additional context

### Checklist
<!-- Please review the following checklist before submitting the issue. -->

- [ ] You have reviewed the [README](https://github.com/sleukhin/serverless-next.js/blob/master/README.md) and [FAQs](https://github.com/sleukhin/serverless-next.js#faq), which answers several common questions.
- [ ] You have reviewed our [DEBUGGING](https://github.com/sleukhin/serverless-next.js/wiki/Debugging-Issues) wiki and have tried your best to include complete information and reproduction steps (including your configuration) as is possible. As there is only one maintainer (who maintains this in his free time) and thus very limited resources, if you have time, please try to debug the issue a bit yourself if possible.
- [ ] You have first tried using the most recent `latest` or `alpha` `@savaleukhin/serverless-component` [release version](https://github.com/sleukhin/serverless-next.js/releases), which may have already fixed your issue or implemented the feature you are trying to use. Note that the old `serverless-next.js` component and the `serverless-next.js` plugin are deprecated and no longer maintained.
